   - Class 8: Topics on analytical methods in plant genomics

### 3. _Crop Bioinformatics_<span style="color:red">(24 hours, 1.5 credits by Dr. Weilong Guo etc)</span>
   Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field to understand biological data combining computational programming, algorithm design, statistics, machine learning. In the past decade, the high-throughput sequencing technology is developed rapidly, and biological data has been accumulated amazingly, bringing opportunities for the field of bioinformatics. This course will follow the key questions in studying crop genome, and introduce the bioinformatics questions, methodology and achievements in aspects of genomics, transcriptomes, proteomics and system biology, respectively. For each topic, we will cover the question definition, data generation, analysis pipeline, computational algorithm and statistic modeling. The aim of this course is to guide student to systematically understand this field, and build a logical scientific thinking. The students would be able to learn the cut-edge research of crop bioinformatics, and gain knowledges and experience for their future relevant career.
   - Chapter 1: Introduction to bioinformatics (2h)
   - Chapter 2: Bioinformatics issue in genomic study (6h)
   - Chapter 3: Bioinformatics issue in transcriptome study (6h)
   - Chapter 4: Bioinformatics issue in proteomic study (2h)
   - Chapter 5: System biology (2h)
   - Chapter 6: Bioinformatics issue in genomic study (2h)
   - Chapter 7: Others aspects of bioinformatics (2h)
   - Chapter 8: Summary in angels of computater scientist and statistician (2h)

### 4. _Bioinformatics Lab_<span style="color:red">(16 hours, 1 credit)</span>
   This course will provide chances for undergraduate student to practice and gain experiences in bioinformatics. This course includes two main experiments. The first one is to build up a Shell pipeline for the alignment of high-throughput sequencing data and the following analysis. The second experiment require student to analysis multiple transcriptomes by normalization, differentially expression analysis, WGCNA analysis and visualization using R script. The two experiments cover both basic raw data analysis, and advance bioinformatics analysis, and will train student to build bioinformatics pipeline, understand parameters and visualize their data. Additionally, this course will provide chance to visit the top bioinformatics company in China, to perform experiment on bioinformatics cloud platform. The leader experts in this field will be invited to share their bioinformatics experiences and career, and introduce the market prospect of bioinformatics.
   1) Build bioinformatics analysis pipeline for alignment of NGS sequencing data (4h).
   2) Learning linux and basic shell commands, install bioinformatics software on computers, and write shell pipeline to align the raw sequencing data to reference genome (4h).
   3) Bioinformatics analysis for “big data” of transcriptomes to build co-expression gene network and data visualization (4h)
   4) By learning R script, carry out statistic and bioinformatics analysis on multiple transcriptome data. In the experiment, students need to normalize the data across samples, generate un-supervised clustering, and finish a WGCNA analysis. Visualize the results using R script, and finish an experimental report (4h).
