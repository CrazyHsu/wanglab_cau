This review demonstrates how to use the Big Data technology to assist basic and translational research in plants; introduces basic concepts and procedures, pitfalls, and remedies of using machine learning; and demonstrates one example of using machine learning for data-driven discovery of stress genes. This work also provides a general framework on how to build the infrastructure to solve the Big Data problems for plant biologists.
