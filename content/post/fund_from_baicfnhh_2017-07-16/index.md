Dr. Wang received a fund from the [Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Food Nutrition and Human Health](http://baicfnhh.cau.edu.cn/) at the CAU (http://baicfnhh.cau.edu.cn/), and he is appointed as guest PI for the center. This project is collaboration with Dr. Feng Chen’s group at the School of Stomatology, Peking University, who has collected DNA samples from 700 babies with cleft lip from Han Chinese and Uygur ethnic group. In this project, we will be studying the genetic interactions with the high-risk predisposing variations in the Cleft-related genes and nutrition-related genes.
