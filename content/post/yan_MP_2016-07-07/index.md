In this work, Jun combined PacBio (∼15x) with Illumina reads (∼40x) to improve the genome assemblies of African wild (Oryza barthii) and cultivated rice (O. glaberrima), and to infer large SVs between O. barthii and O. glaberrima. This study illustrates the potential of PacBio single-molecule sequencing in expediting the process of gene discovery for crop improvement and downstream functional validation of candidate genes. This work is collaboration between Prof. Zuofeng Zhu’s lab at CAU and Prof. Xing-Wang Deng’s at Peking University, download the original paper from our Publication list.
